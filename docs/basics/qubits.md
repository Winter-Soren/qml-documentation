# Qubits
Qubit aka Quantum Bit (The Quantum Bits that Think Outside the Binary Box)

Forget the 0s and 1s you know from regular computers. In the strange world of quantum, information comes in a whole new flavor called qubits. Think of them as the essential building blocks of quantum machine learning (QML), the superpowered cousin of AI.

But what makes these qubits so special? Buckle up, because we're diving into the quantum weirdness:

**Beyond the Binary**: Unlike their classical counterparts, qubits aren't limited to just being 0 or 1. They can exist in a state called superposition (we will study this concept later), where they're both 0 and 1 at the same time! Imagine a light switch that's not just on or off, but somehow dimmed to both states simultaneously. That's the mind-bending power of superposition.

**Probabilities Play the Game**: While a regular bit gives you a definitive answer (0 or 1 only), a qubit's state is described by probabilities. Think of it like a spinning coin â€“ the longer it spins, the closer it gets to landing on heads or tails, but until it stops, both possibilities exist with certain probabilities.

**Entangled and Unstoppable**: Qubits can also be entangled, a phenomenon where the state of one qubit instantly influences the state of another, no matter how far apart they are. It's like having a pair of magic coins that always land on the same side, no matter how far you separate them. Or think of it as a pair of best friends who always finish each other's sentences, no matter where they are.

### What are qubits made of?
Just like classical bits are made by turning on or off the electrical current, qubits are made by manipulating the state of subatomic particles (particles like electrons, photons, or ions). Generally Gold/Iron ions are used to create qubits. These particles have a property called "spin," which can be used to represent the 0 and 1 states of a qubit.
