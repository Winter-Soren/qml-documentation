# Quantum Gates and Circuits

In fundamentals, we learned about qubits and their states. Now, in order to change the state of qubits at our will, we need to perform some operations on them. These operations are performed by quantum gates. When we combine these gates together, we get a quantum circuit.

PS: Brace yourself, as our journey into quantum gates and circuits is going to be a bit (or more) bumpy. Psssst...!! Don't scroll down faster, you may have anxiety issues. Just kidding, scroll down as fast as you want.
