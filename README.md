## Project Structure
The project structure is as follows:
```
├───.github
│   ├───ISSUE_TEMPLATE
│   └───workflows
├───docs
|    |-index.md
|    └───stylesheets
|        ├───extra.css
|-mkdocs.yml           
```

`mkdocs.yml` is the configuration file for the documentation, it contains the site name, the pages, and the theme.

`docs` is the folder that contains the documentation pages, it contains the `index.md` file which is the home page of the documentation, and the `stylesheets` folder which contains the `extra.css` file that contains the custom styles for the documentation.

To create a new page (ie the tab), go to `docs` folder and create a new markdown file with the name of the page you want to create. Automatically, the new page will be added to the navigation bar.

If you want to add any new pulgins, then refer to this website for reference [mkdocs plugins](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/plugins/)

If you want to change the setup of the documentation, then refer to this website for reference [mkdocs setup](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/)
